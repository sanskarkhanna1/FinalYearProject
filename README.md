# FinalYearProject
The aim of this project was to create a comprehensive chatbot platform that offers a wide range of functionalities in various domains. The platform, named "CHATHUB" serves as a central hub for multiple chatbots, each designed to cater to specific user needs.
The chatbots developed
include:
• ChikitsaBOT: A health-focused chatbot that provides medical assistance, advice, and information to users.
• VidyarthiBOT: An educational chatbot designed to support students by offering study
resources, answering academic queries, and providing learning recommendations.
• BanduBOT: A chatbot dedicated to fostering friendship and social interaction, offering
conversation, advice, and companionship.
• YatraBOT: A travel information chatbot that assists users in planning trips, providing
destination details, and offering recommendations.
• BawarchiBOT: A recipe chatbot that helps users discover and explore various culinary
recipes, cooking techniques, and ingredient substitutions.
• ManoranjanBOT: An entertainment chatbot that offers users a range of entertainment
recommendations, including movies, TV shows, books, and music.
The implementation of this platform involved utilizing Django, Python, APIs, AI technologies, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These tools and frameworks were leveraged to create
an interactive and user-friendly chatbot interface.
Additionally, a Python library called "SansArLIB" was developed as part of this project.
This library encompasses various utility functions and modules that streamline the development
and integration of chatbots into the ChatHUB platform.
The project successfully achieved its objectives of centralizing multiple chatbots into a
single platform, providing users with a comprehensive and diverse range of functionalities. The
ChatHUB platform offers a convenient and efficient means for users to access different chatbots,
catering to their specific needs and interests.
Overall, this project demonstrates the effectiveness of using Django, Python, APIs, AI,
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop a multi-functional chatbot platform, enhancing user
experiences in health, education, friendship, travel, recipes, and entertainment domains.
